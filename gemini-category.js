    "For too long, David Coltart has waged a relentless smear campaign against Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC), targeting its black administrators with baseless accusations lacking any credible evidence. Coltart\u2019s frequent social media tirades \u2013 disguised as the voice of \u201cconcerned cricket lovers\u201d \u2013 in reality propagate a deeply divisive and damaging narrative. His rhetoric threatens the unity and progress that ZC has painstakingly built over many years. However, Coltart\u2019s persistent claims of non-existent racist policies are both dangerous and deplorable. Such accusations distract from the real work of developing Zimbabwean cricket and erode public trust in a fair, transparent system. The ICC Anti-Discrimination Code prohibits conduct \u201clikely to offend, insult, humiliate, intimidate, threaten, disparage or vilify any reasonable person . on the basis of their race, religion, culture, colour, descent, national or ethnic origin\u201d. Discrimination in team selection, administration or any aspect of our operations will never be tolerated. In a Daily Telegraph opinion piece on 31 December 2002 titled \u2018Politics has no place in sport \u2013 so boycott the World Cup\u2019, Coltart argued against the ICC\u2019s principle of separating sport and politics. For 23 years, England froze bilateral cricket relations with Zimbabwe \u2013 a freeze that only ended in May 2025, when the current ZC administration successfully negotiated a historic one-off Test at Trent Bridge. In 2018, he publicly acknowledged his past role and expressed regret for supporting an unjust system that discriminated against black people. Yet his ongoing social media campaign betrays a lack of true repentance. The progress ZC has made speaks louder than Coltart\u2019s bitter diatribes. And we categorically reject Coltart\u2019s cynical campaign to destabilise the sport."

    "However, in recent years, this delicate balance has been disrupted by a new wave of researchers and multinational corporations, all seeking to unlock the secrets hidden within the region's genetic resources. \"We have watched as our traditional medicines and cultural heritage have been taken, studied and patented without our knowledge or fair compensation,\" lamented Thando Mbatha, a community leader from the KwaZulu-Natal province, in a recent meeting. In recent years, a concerning pattern has emerged across the region. Researchers, often from wealthy nations, have descended upon remote villages, extracting samples of plants and animals with little input or consent from the people whose ancestral knowledge and lands have sustained these resources for generations. This imbalance has led to acrimonious encounters between researchers and local communities, who proclaim that they have documented indigenous knowledge systems (IKS) and experiences involved in the development of certain plant-based medicines or other genetic resources. \"Our IKSs have sustained these resources for centuries, and we deserve a fair share of the benefits when they are commercialised,\" she noted. \"That case highlighted the urgent need for stronger legal policy frameworks and benefit-sharing mechanisms,\" said Mutasa. \"We cannot allow our natural resources and traditional knowledge to be exploited for private gain, without equitable distribution of the rewards,\" he affirmed. \u201cIt's not enough to simply consult communities after the fact,\u201d Nkosi said. \"Local ecological knowledge holds the key to unlocking community-driven solutions for navigating complex national development challenges and forging pathways to economic and national resilience,\u201d said a Development Studies Lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe.
